# Shapes

Uses [OPZjs](github.com/nbw/opz) to parse input from the OP-Z.

## Note

I wrote this project entirely in Javascript with on frameworks. I'm not expecting to win any medals
for superb HTML/CSS/JS design. There parts of the code that are a bit tedious (especially the
settings menu setup), but that's what frameworks are for.

## Development Notes

### Building Javascript Assets

1. Node
2. Install browserify

```
npm install -g browserify
```

3. Install deps (mostly Babel)

```
npm install
```

4. Build script.js

```
npm run build
```

## OP-Z Assets

Feel free to use the OP-Z assets in the project. I made them myself.

If you want the Adobe Illustrator file contact me.
